# 🐤 Flappy Bird Clone (Unity)

A simple Flappy Bird-style game built with Unity, focused on gameplay programming, mechanics, and responsive controls. Developed as part of my journey to improve core gameplay coding without spending time on visuals or asset creation.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Tap or press space to flap
- Navigate through randomly spaced pipe pairs
- Score increases for every successful pass through the gap
- Game ends when the player hits a pipe or falls off-screen

## 🧠 Features

- Unity 2D physics-based character movement
- Randomized pipe spawning and movement
- Object pooling and cleanup to manage performance
- Scoring system with UI integration (TextMeshPro)
- Simple main menu with "Start", "How to Play", and "Exit"
- Input control handling and game state transitions

## 🎯 Goals

This project focuses on:

- Practicing 2D physics-based gameplay logic
- Managing prefab instantiation and cleanup
- UI management and button-based scene control
- Working with colliders and triggers for scoring and collision detection
- Clean separation between input, logic, and UI

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Unity 2022+ / Unity 6
- C#
- TextMeshPro for UI
- GitHub for version control

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- No art assets beyond placeholder sprites
- No sound or animation (focus was purely on logic and mechanics)
- No mobile support implemented yet
